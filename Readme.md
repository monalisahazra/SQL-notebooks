# SQL-notebooks

Here I have uploaded a few SQL-notebooks that are helpful in data exploration. These are jupyter notebooks built in azure data studio. The notebook is bases on MSSQL. 

I have also uploaded a simple R-markdown file to show the use of SQLDF. 

The notebooks contain examples of mainly the following:

1. Creating and handling the tables in sql

2. Data manipulation and control.

3. SQL Project 2 contains different queries and also the differences between MySQL and MsSQL
